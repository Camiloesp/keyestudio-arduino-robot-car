# 🚗 Keyestudio 4WD Smart Car – Arduino Robotics

This project is based on the Keyestudio Upgraded 4WD BT Multi-purpose Smart Car V2.0 kit. 
I followed and coded the tutorials that came with it as a way to get started with robotics and Arduino programming.
What led me to pick up this project was my love for programming and curiosity for robotics.

## 🔧 What’s Inside

The tutorials covered the basics of how the car works, step by step:

* Motor Control – learning how to make the wheels spin, stop, and turn.
* Bluetooth Control – connecting the car to a phone app and driving it wirelessly.
* Line Tracking – using sensors to follow a black line on the ground.
* Obstacle Avoidance – making the car detect and avoid objects in its way.
* IR Remote – controlling the car with an infrared remote.
* Light & Sound Features – using LEDs and a buzzer for signals/feedback.

## 🛠️ Tech I Used

* Arduino IDE – to write and upload the code.
* Arduino Uno R3 (Keyestudio board) – the “brain” of the car.
* C/C++ (Arduino language) – for programming.
* Ultrasonic, IR, and line-tracking sensors – for navigation and obstacle detection.
* Bluetooth module – to control the car wirelessly from a phone.
